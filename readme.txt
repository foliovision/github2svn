Beta version for developers only! Sync your Github repositories to WordPress SVN for plugin updates.

== Description ==

This is the version of plugin which worked for us, but it might not work in your server environment. Use carefully.

It's for plugin developers who maintain repositories on Github and need a way of commiting the changes from Githut to WordPress SVN directly. Plugin also has a feature for tagging the releases.

== Installation ==

Your server need to have git and svn installed and the exec() PHP call has to be enabled.

Before commiting any plugin you have to enter the plugin information and click "Add Plugin".

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
